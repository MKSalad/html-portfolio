    <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is KHALID HASSAN SALAD.</p>
<p> I am passionate about web development and am currently working small projects as front-end developer. </p>

<p>I enjoy turning creative ideas into functional websites and exploring new ways to make them user-friendly and visually appealing.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I love [reading, learning new ideas or having good time with my family].</p> 

My goal is to become a skilled developer who can build impactful and accessible websites that leave a positive impression
